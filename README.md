# Controlled-Lapse
A python application to open folders full of incemental images (possibly not incremental) and compile them into a time lapse video. The main feature of this application is to control the speed of different periods of the time lapse so that parts can be emphasized easily.

This project started when I was doing a 10-day long camping roadtrip and decided 2 days before that I wanted to document the drive. The images were taken with a camera hooked up to a raspberypi and roughly thrown into a youtube video. Unfortunately, I got the pi a few days before driving accross the country and had to use a very badly outdated webcam for the photos, so the quality is potato. The images were taken during a full daylight of driving from circa New Orleans to West Texas.
